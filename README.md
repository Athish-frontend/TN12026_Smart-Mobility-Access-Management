# TN12026_Smart-Mobility-Access-Management
Enhancing Brain-Computer Interface Efficiency for Real-Time Wheelchair Control
Overview
The Brain-Controlled Smart Wheelchair is a hands-free mobility system designed for individuals with severe motor disabilities. It uses non-invasive EEG signals to capture brain activity, which is processed in real time using machine learning algorithms and then translated into wheelchair movement commands. The prototype is built using Arduino Uno, HC-05 Bluetooth module, L298N motor driver, and an EEG headset (or laptop preprocessing for cost efficiency). In future, it also includes obstacle detection sensors and LM2596-based power management, ensuring both safety and reliability. Unlike traditional wheelchairs that depend on manual controls or voice commands, this prototype allows users to move using only their thoughts. With its low-cost, offline-capable, and scalable design, the system is suitable for deployment in hospitals, rehabilitation centers, and personal use, empowering motor-disabled individuals with independence and dignity.
Features
•	EEG-based control – Converts brain signals into forward, backward, left, and right movements.
•	Real-time preprocessing & ML – Ensures responsive and accurate signal interpretation.
•	Safety-first design – Threshold logic, duplicate command filtering, and obstacle avoidance sensors.
Functionalities
•	EEG Input: NeuroSense MindWave (for prototype uses laptop preprocessing)
•	Microcontroller: Arduino Uno 
•	Communication: HC-05 Bluetooth Module
Problem Statement
Millions of people suffering from ALS, spinal cord injuries, strokes, and neuromuscular diseases are deprived of voluntary muscle control, making conventional wheelchairs unusable. The core problem: Lack of an intuitive, non-invasive, and independent mobility solution for individuals with severe motor impairments.
Our Solution
The prototype addresses this gap by providing:
Hands-free navigation through EEG brain signals. Real-time processing and machine learning for reliability. Scalable, low-cost hardware suitable for hospitals, rehab centers, and personal use This innovation restores independence, dignity, and social inclusion for individuals with limited mobility.
Impact & Scalability
•	Low-cost and accessible hardware (Arduino, L298N, EEG headset)
•	Easily replicable infrastructure for deployment in hospitals, care centers, or public events
•	Offline-capable system ensures usability in rural as well as urban areas
Future Scope
•	AI integration for intent prediction (eye-tracking, facial expressions, voice commands)
•	IoT & Cloud connectivity for caregiver monitoring and remote assistance
•	Health monitoring (ECG, BP, SpO₂) with emergency alerts
